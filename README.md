# Workday Scheduler: Matt Kelly

Improve your daily productivity with this workday scheduler, powered by jQuery. This scheduling app is a web based application, designed to run in your web browser. The workday scheduler features a total of 8 timeslots, colour coded to indicate their state in time, being either past, present or future. Grey indicates past, red indicates present and green indicates future timeslots. Timeslot colours are updated automatically based on local time. 

To use this application, click on a timeslot and write a task for that slot. Once you have strategically planned your daily tasks, click the save button. The recorded tasks will now be saved in local storage. To change or delete a task, simply click on a task and rewrite it, or delete the task. Hit the save button to re-save the changed or deleted task in local storage.
